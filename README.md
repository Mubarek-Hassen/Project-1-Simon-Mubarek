## Simon The Game
1. first, build a playground for the player and Simon.
2. On the playground, we create a screen for simon to pass his order of colors. Simon will be calling out from 4 different colors.
3. on the player's side of the playground, there are 4 buttons that are equivalent with the colors from Simon.
4. Simon will be assigned an array of colors and he will randomly print the colors within the setInterval.
5. the player's buttons are also assigned an array of colors that match Simon's colors array.
6. if the player's clicked button match Simon's printed color, score will increment. else, score will decrement and player gets to lose a chance to fail again. If player fails twice, game will be over and score will show up on simon's screen.
7. if player keeps on clicking the right pattern, speed/ time interval of simon printing the colors will increase, making it more difficult each round to follow along Simon.
